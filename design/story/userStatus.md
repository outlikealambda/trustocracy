## User Status
Display at:
1. a votable level (each bill)
2. a permanent level (default state)

Displayed info:
- The delegate I am following
- My follower count
    - immediate children
    - total
- My upstream chain
    - upstream comments
    - includes vote with terminating comment
- The size of my voting tree


Notes:
1. should be summarize-able
    - how have my followers changed?
    - how has my tree voted?
2. should be navigable
    - (question for us) how do we succinctly identify votables (bills)?
